                <h4>Linus Sebastian | CEO and Host</h4>
                Starting out as a hardware enthusiast and working part time at NCIX, Linus rose through the ranks to become a full time sales representative, high end systems designer, product manager, to category manager. Creating YouTube content was always a side component of his job so in 2013 he founded Linus Media Group and left NCIX to pursue a career in educational entertainment focused on tech. <br>

                <h4>Luke Lafreniere | Chief of Technology</h4>
                An expert in many things technological, Luke (AKA SlickPC) signed up to help Linus with his duties at NCIX and Linus Tech Tips. What gave him the edge in the application process was his PC build cooled by oil (garnering him the moniker Slick). When Linus left NCIX to start his own company, Luke went with him.
                <br> Since then, Luke's duties have expanded beyond testing hardware to include hosting videos and managing the LinusTechTips.com community. <br>

                A tech enthusiast driven by gaming performance, Edzel was an NCIX lurker and shopper for years. With a history of visual arts, he pursued video production and when he had to find an internship, Edzel went to YouTube and messaged Linus about being an intern. That went on for a couple of months until he was eventually offered a job. <br>

                <h4>Brandon Lee | Cinematographer</h4>
                A broadcast student from BCIT, Brandon joined the team early 2013, and is our resident "gear guru" when it comes to the latest filming equipment and techniques.
                <br> He started out primarily as a video editor, but his true calling has always been behind the camera and Brandon spends almost all his time looking through a lens at either one of our video hosts or at a piece of cool technology. <br>

                <h4>Taran Van Hemert | Editor</h4>
                Taran joined the team during one of the busiest periods in this history of Linus Media Group. It was so busy, in fact that even our seasoned veterans felt the heat, but Taran soldiered through intense work and injury to become the chief editor of our flagship Linus Tech Tips channel. So if there are any problems you know who to blame.
                <br> Taran prides himself on the speed and efficiency of his workflow. He is our resident repetitive strain injury expert (if you know what I mean), and he also occasionally writes and hosts videos. <br>

                <h4>Nick Light | Sales & Biz Dev</h4>
                Nick coordinates the sale of pre-rolls and other projects along with general business development and strategy. It sounds boring, but much like a clock, Linus Media Group just wouldn't "tick" quite the same without him. <br>

                Colton does sales and focuses on business development, as well as some operational aspects for the company. He manages the community e-mails and helps with the WAN Show. We would say he's a very fun loving person, who's a great team member. <br>

                Nick likes to do fake Aussie accents. He is the (criminal?) mastermind behind most of the Channel Super Fun content you see. Without him, Channel Super Fun wouldn't be as epic as it is now. <br>

                Jon is our first foreign worker, moving to Vancouver to join Linus Media Group from the faraway land of North Carolina. We're led to believe that's somewhere in the United States of Amsterdam or something. Geography is not a strong point for us.
                <br> But what does he do...? Well, did you ever wonder why Fast As Possible videos have sounded more complicated and factual lately? That's Jon. Thanks Jon. <br>

                <h4>Dennis Liao | Editor</h4>
                His original placeholder bio said "A guy we knew from school. Sometimes he knows how to make videos." but Linus is re-writing it now, so here goes:
                <br> Dennis joined our team after receiving a very strong recommendation for his hard work and skill at both shooting and editing videos under tight deadlines. Several team members had experience working with him at school so I went ahead with the hire after a single interview, which.. crud.. I just basically wrote the same thing..
                <br> In Edzel's defense, what he wrote originally wasn't actually that racist and was mostly factual. <br>
